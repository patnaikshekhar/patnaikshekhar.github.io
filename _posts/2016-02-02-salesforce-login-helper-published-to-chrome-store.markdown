Salesforce Login Helper which is my attempt at making an easy to use tool to allow you to manage the logins of multiple Salesforce orgs has now been released.

It is now available on the chrome app store on the [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce-login-helper/lphjfeeaniomnoomcplfomgonemdmplf)

I have also uploaded a tutorial of the extension on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XVmU9s29zM&feature=youtu.be)
